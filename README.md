## Course Description

This course is the next helping of statistics and research methodology after PS2020. We will begin with a thorough investigation of regression and the general linear model, and then move on to more advanced techniques such as logit and probit analysis, models for ordinal dependent variables, and models for causal inference. Students will be exposed to the theory of these methods as well as to practical ways of using them in concrete research situations.

There are two main goals of the course: to enable students to read, understand and critique existing quantitative literature in political science; and to have students acquire the skills to conduct original quantitative research in their own substantive field of interest.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be based on a 20–25 page research paper (46%, including 10% for preparation of a poster presentation of the paper), and three homework exercises which relate to specific statistical methods and problems we will discuss (54% altogether). The paper will be a quantitative analysis, using multiple regression or some of the other methods we cover in the course, of data that you will collect or access from social science archives or other sources. Ideally, the paper should have some substantive interest to you or be relevant to your studies in the graduate program. The paper will discuss your basic theoretical framework, your hypotheses, statistical models, results, possible problems with the analysis, and what you may have done to correct or account for these problems. It will conclude with a discussion of the relevance of your findings for the general topic and for future research. The homework exercises will be periodic problems or data sets to analyze and will illustrate aspects of the statistical techniques being covered in class.

## Course Outline

The course is organized by units and then topics within units. We will maintain a certain amount of flexibility with the schedule, so that we can spend more time on some topics/units and scale back on others as circumstances warrant.
